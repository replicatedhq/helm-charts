Replicated library chart

This is a library chart maintained by Replicated in order to keep the creation of helm charts dry when deploying third party commercial software

## Requirements

Kubernetes: `>=1.16.0-0`

## Releasing

Ensure the version number is set in `Chart.yaml` for the version you want to release.

Add your changes to the file `README_CHANGELOG.md.gotmpl`. The format for using this file is documented in the file itself.

You need to have [Helm Docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs) installed. Then run the following command to update the README and README_CHANGELOG files.

```
helm-docs -t README.md.gotmpl -t README_CHANGELOG.md.gotmpl -t README_CONFIG.md.gotmpl
```
